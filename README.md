# Fake News Detection Using Logistic Regression and NLP
This project demonstrates a machine learning pipeline to classify news articles as fake or real using a combination of natural language processing (NLP) techniques and a Logistic Regression classifier.

# üîç Dataset
The dataset includes two CSV files:
Fake.csv: Contains fake news articles.
True.csv: Contains real news articles.
These files are merged and labeled (1 for fake, 0 for real).

# ‚öôÔ∏è Workflow
Text Cleaning: Lowercasing, contraction handling, punctuation removal, stopword filtering, and lemmatization using spaCy and NLTK.
Feature Extraction: TF-IDF vectorization with unigrams and bigrams (max_features=5000).
Model: Logistic Regression trained on 67% of the dataset.
Evaluation:
Accuracy: 98.79%
F1-score: 0.99
Confusion Matrix: Shows very low false positives/negatives.

sklearn: TF-IDF, Logistic Regression, metrics
re for regex-based text cleaning

# üõ†Ô∏è Future Work
Upgrade to deep learning models like BERT for better semantic understanding.
Include subject classification as a multi-label task.
Deploy using a simple web interface for real-time news checks.
